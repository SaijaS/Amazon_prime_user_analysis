New Project : Amazon Prime Users Analytics | Power BI

I’m happy to share my latest data analytics Project - an Interactive dashboard that provides key insights into amazon prime users through different age categories. when I started to work on this project, a series of questions helped me to understand the relationship between data and business insights.

What is data?, Why are we using past data for analysis? And how are these data insights helping the business to grow?

Highlights of Project:

Import the Amazon user dataset into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.

Find the age and age category using the date of Birth for user age-based analysis. Built interactive KPIs to track the total number of customers, Average user age of prime users, and Average rating.

Designed visual charts to analyze user's interaction and patterns by age category, gender, Renewal status, subscription plan, and favorite genere.

Insights Derived:

The platform currently has 2,500 active users with an average age of 55.63 years and an average rating of 4.0, indicating a generally satisfied user base.

Device usage patterns reveals that smartphones and tablets are the most popular streaming devices, particularly among middle and senior adult users. This highlights the need for continuous optimization of the mobile experience and improved user interfaces for larger screens.

Subscription analysis shows a near-even split between annual and monthly plans, with roughly half of users enabling auto-renew, presenting an opportunity for Amazon to increase customer retention through discounts and loyalty incentives for annual auto-renewal plans.

Content preference analysis indicates strong genre variations by age group. Teenagers are more attracted to drama and comedy, while older and senior adults favor action and horror. These findings suggest that personalized content recommendations and age-targeted marketing campaigns could enhance engagement and satisfaction.

Tools Used : Excel | Power BI | DAX | Data Modelling | Data Visualization
